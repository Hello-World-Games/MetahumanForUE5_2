# MetahumanForUE5_2
An easy-to-use template for adding MetaHumans to Unreal Engine 5.2 and onwards!

All you need to do is:

1. Download the project and run it on Unreal Engine 5.2.1 (or another version if you really want to take the time to reversion it)
2. Import your MetaHuman from the Quixel Bridge.
3. Open the `BP_Player` blueprint and your MetaHuman's blueprint.
4. Copy everything in the `root` tag of your MetaHuman, and replace it with the `root` tag in the BP_Player blueprint.

Done! The player should now be your MetaHuman. You can now do whatever you want to do with it.
(I used a custom Metahuman, not that it really makes any difference, just saying.)
