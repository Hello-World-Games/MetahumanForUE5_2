# MetahumanForUE5_2
An easy-to-use template for adding MetaHumans to Unreal Engine 5.2 and onwards!

All you need to do is:

1. Import your MetaHuman from the Quixel Bridge.
2. Open the `BP_Player` blueprint and your MetaHuman's blueprint.
3. Copy everything in the `root` tag of your MetaHuman, and replace it with the `root` tag in the BP_Player blueprint.

Done! The player should now be a MetaHuman. You can now do whatever you want to do with it.
